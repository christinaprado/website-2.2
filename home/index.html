      <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
      <p>I am a second-year college student at Asia Pacific College taking the course RSTT-1.</p>
      <p>I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with specialization in Mobile and Internet Technologies.</p>
      <p>When it comes to experience with IT, I also learned to code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in 9th grade and I really enjoyed it, and that encouraged me to take it. I also really enjoy creating using webpages because it is my favorite subject.</p>
