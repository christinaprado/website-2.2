<h1>Personal Profile Web page</h1>    

<br>Hi! My name is Christina Prado, I am a second-year college student in Asia Pacific College taking the course BSIT-MI.

<br>BSIT-MI, Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with specialization in Mobile and Internet Technologies.   

<br>When it comes to my experience with IT, I first learned to code using HTML when I was in 9th grade and I really enjoyed it,
and that encouraged me to take IT. I also really enjoyed creating an ERD Diagaram on our DATAMA! subject.    

<br>My hobbies are exploring, walking, eating out with friends, cleaning, organizing, and interacting with my dogs.

<br>My goals in life are having multiple streams of income, be financially stable, and living a long healthy life.
